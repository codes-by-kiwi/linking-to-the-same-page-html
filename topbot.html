    <h2>About Cats</h2>
    <p> They are animals that have a strong night vision and sense of smell. According to Egyptian myth, 
        they were used to scare mummies away if they came back to life. They have a very good balance 
        that allows them to always land on their paws. They sleep from 12 to 16 hours in a day. 
        Tail raising indicates the cat's position as being the highest in the social hierachy.
